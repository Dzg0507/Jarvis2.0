# ElevenLabs TTS Constructor Error Fix

## Problem
The `/api/tts` endpoint was throwing "ElevenLabsTTS is not a constructor" error when trying to instantiate the ElevenLabsTTS class.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the `'use client';` directive at the top of `lib/elevenlabs.ts`, which made it a client-side module that cannot be imported in server-side API routes.

## Solution
Created a separate server-side module to resolve the client/server module conflict:

### 1. Created `lib/elevenlabs-server.ts`
- **Purpose**: Server-side only ElevenLabs TTS implementation
- **Content**: Contains ElevenLabsTTS class, Voice interfaces, and voice mapping functions
- **Usage**: For API routes and server-side code only
- **No client directive**: Can be safely imported in server-side contexts

### 2. Updated `app/api/tts/route.ts`
- **Changed import**: From `@/lib/elevenlabs` to `@/lib/elevenlabs-server`
- **Result**: ElevenLabsTTS class now instantiates correctly in the API route

### 3. Maintained `lib/elevenlabs.ts`
- **Purpose**: Client-side TTS management and UI components
- **Content**: TTSManager class, client-side utilities, and UI helpers
- **Usage**: For React components and client-side functionality
- **Keeps client directive**: Required for browser-specific features like localStorage

## File Structure
```
lib/
â”œâ”€â”€ elevenlabs.ts          # Client-side TTS (with 'use client')
â””â”€â”€ elevenlabs-server.ts   # Server-side TTS (no client directive)

app/api/tts/
â””â”€â”€ route.ts              # Uses elevenlabs-server.ts

components/ui/
â”œâ”€â”€ tts-controls.tsx      # Uses elevenlabs.ts
â””â”€â”€ voice-settings.tsx    # Uses elevenlabs.ts
```

## Verification
- âœ… Build successful: `npm run build` passes
- âœ… Development server: `npm run dev:next` works
- âœ… API endpoint: `/api/tts` responds correctly (HTTP 200)
- âœ… Constructor: ElevenLabsTTS instantiates without errors
- âœ… Audio generation: API returns audio data (23KB+ response)

## Benefits
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear distinction between client and server TTS code
2. **No Breaking Changes**: Existing client-side components continue to work
3. **Proper Module Resolution**: Server-side code uses server-compatible modules
4. **Maintainable**: Each file has a specific purpose and context

## Testing
The fix was verified by:
1. Successful build compilation
2. API endpoint testing with curl
3. HTTP 200 response with audio data
4. No constructor errors in server logs

The TTS functionality is now fully operational! ðŸŽ‰
